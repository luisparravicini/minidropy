`drop.py` is a small script to perform certain operations using the Dropbox API:

- List the contents of certain remote folder. The output is one file per line, and each line lists the file's id, path and server modified time, separated with `\t`.
- Download a file, referenced by it's id. It downloads the file in a local folder, adding a `metadata.json` along with it.
- Upload a file, downloaded beforehand with the `download` option of this script and referenced by it's local path.
- Listing of remote path. Reads `metadata.json` and lists the path of the downloaded file as it's stored in Dropbox.

It needs a token stored in a file. Go to <https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps> to get one.

All the parameters accepted are listed below:
